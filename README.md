# BCPalgorithmForPython
The BCP Algorithm For Python2.7

## A brief overview about BCP algorithm

### Firstly we should know the concept of Additive Homomorphic Cryptosystem
> Suppose [M<sub>1</sub>]<sub>pk</sub> and [m<sub>2</sub>]<sub>pk</sub> are two additive homomorphic ciphertexts under the same public key pk. The additive homomorphic cryptosystem (AHC) has the additive homomorphic property:

> <center> D<sub>sk</sub> ([M<sub>1</sub>]<sub>pk</sub> * [M<sub>2</sub>]<sub>pk</sub>) = M<sun>1</sub> + M<sub>2</sub></center >

> **BCP** is an Additive Homomorphic Cryptosystem. besides, it has a special property which offers two independent decryption mechanisms, The second decryption mechanism decrypts given ciphertext successfully if and only if a certain master secret key is known.
